# About Me



I am currently working on [NebulaStream](https://github.com/nebulastream), where I contribute to the novel query compiler Nautilus 
Additionally, I work as a Research Assistant at the [Database Systems and Information Management](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dima) 
research group at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), under the excellent guidance of [Philipp M. Grulich](https://grulich.me//) 
and [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Volker Markl](https://www.tu.berlin/dima/ueber-uns/prof-dr-volker-markl).

In the past I had the opportunity to work at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/en/web),
the [German – Turkish Advanced Research Centre for ICT](https://gt-arc.com/) and at the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://dai-labor.de/en/home/)
under the guidance of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Dr. h.c. Sahin Albayrak](https://dai-labor.de/team/sahin-albayrak/).

I have a bachelors degree in Economics from Universität Mannheim, where I did my thesis on the correlation between stock reports and uncertainty.
While doing my Economics degree I fell in love with C++ and programming in general. Hence, I decided to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science 
at the Technische Universität Berlin, with a specialization in distributed systems and cloud/network technologies. Additionally, I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science at TU-Berlin, where I focused on compiler technologies, stream processing systems and scalable data processing on modern hardware.

I live in Hamburg and Berlin while working remotely at [NebulaStream](https://github.com/nebulastream) and doing some freelancing. I am open for new challenges, so feel free to reach out to me via (mail)[1] or (LinkedIn)[www.linkedin.com/in/victor-bieszka]!
