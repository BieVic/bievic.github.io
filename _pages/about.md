# About Me

I’m passionate about programming languages such as C++ and Rust, with a strong focus on compiler technologies, WebAssembly, and systems programming. 
At the moment, I’m contributing to the WebAssembly runtime Wasmtime and enjoy hacking on RISC-V and other low-level technologies in my free time.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Lufthansa Technik AG, where I apply my expertise in distributed systems and software engineering to build robust, critical
solutions for the aviation industry.
Before that I worked on [NebulaStream](https://github.com/nebulastream), where I contributed to the novel query compiler Nautilus, 
and worked as a Research Assistant at the [Database Systems and Information Management](https://www.tu.berlin/en/dima) 
research group at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), under the excellent guidance of [Philipp M. Grulich](https://grulich.me//) 
and [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Volker Markl](https://www.tu.berlin/dima/ueber-uns/prof-dr-volker-markl).

In the past I had the opportunity to work at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/en/web),
the [German – Turkish Advanced Research Centre for ICT](https://gt-arc.com/) and at the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://dai-labor.de/en/home/)
under the guidance of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Dr. h.c. Sahin Albayrak](https://dai-labor.de/team/sahin-albayrak/).

My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Universität Mannheim, where I explored the relationship between stock reports 
and uncertainty in my thesis. During that time, I discovered my passion for C++ and programming, which led me to pursue a second Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science 
at Technische Universität Berlin, specializing in distributed systems and cloud/network technologies. 
I later earned a Master’s degree in Computer Science at TU Berlin, where I focused on compiler technologies, stream processing systems, 
and scalable data processing on modern hardware.

I'm based in Hamburg and do some additional freelancing as a React Native Developer. I am open for new challenges, so feel free to reach out to me via [mail][1]
